<p>As a user, because I want to track my meals, I want to add new meals into my log</p>
<p>As a user, because I want to be able to compare my Meals over time, I want to be able to query for meals over a
time range.</p>
<p>As a user, because it's impossible to make an application never close, I want my meal log available as a file. </p>
<p>As a user, because retrospectively adding food to my meals is tedious, I want to be able to eat and have that Food counted as a Meal</p>
<p>As a user, because I am not a number, dammit, I want Muncher to refer to me by a user-friendly name.</p>
<p>As a user, because I'm not a programmer, I want a console that allows me to recollect Meals and log a Meal</p>
